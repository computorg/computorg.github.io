## Aims and scope

Computo has been created in the context of a reproducibility crisis in
science, which calls for higher standards in the publication of
scientific results. Computo aims at promoting
computational/algorithmic contributions in statistics and machine
learning (ML) that provide insight into which models or methods are the
most appropriate to address a specific scientific question.

The journal welcomes the following types of contributions:

- New **methods** with original stats/ML developments, or numerical
  studies that illustrate theoretical results in stats/ML;
- **Case studies** or **surveys** on stats/ML methods to address a specific
  (type of) question in data analysis, neutral comparison studies that
  provide insight into when, how, and why the compared methods perform
  well or less well;
- **Software/tutorial papers** to present implementations of stats/ML algorithms or
  to feature the use of a package/toolbox. For such papers we expect not only the description of an existing implementation but also the study of a concrete use case. If applicable, a comparison to related works and appropriate benchmarking are also expected.

## An open access journal with reproducible contributions

Computo is free for readers and authors.
It is an open access journal which means that all content is
freely available without charge to the user or his/her institution.
Users are allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print,
search, or link to the full texts of the articles, or use
them for any other lawful purpose, without asking prior permission
from the publisher or the author. This is in accordance with the
Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) definition of open access.

The reproducibility of numerical results is a necessary condition for
publication in Computo. In particular, submissions must include all
necessary data (e.g. via Zenodo repositories) and code.  For
contributions featuring the implementation of methods/algorithms, the
quality of the provided code is assessed during the review process.
We accept contributions in the form of notebooks (e.g. Rmarkdown, or
Jupyter).

The reviews are open, i.e. visible to any reader after acceptance of
the contribution. Reviewers may choose to remain anonymous or not.
