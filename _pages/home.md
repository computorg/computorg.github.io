This journal aims at promoting computational/algorithmic contributions
in statistics and machine learning that provide insight into which
models or methods are more appropriate to address a specific
scientific question. In order to achieve this goal, Computo goes
beyond classical static publications by leveraging technical advances
in literate programming and scientific reporting.
