## Overview

Submissions  to Computo  require  both  scientific content  (typically
equations,  codes, and  figures)  and  a proof  that  this content  is
reproducible.  This  is achieved  via  the  standard notebook  systems
available for R,  Python, and Julia, coupled with  the binder building
system.

A Computo submission is thus a git(hub) repository typically containing

- the  source of  the notebook  (a markdown  file with yaml metadata) ;
- auxiliary  files, e.g.:  a $$\mathrm{bib}\TeX  $$ file,  some static
figures  in  the `figs/`  subdirectory,  configuration  files for  the
binder  environment to  setup the  machine that  will build  the final
notebook file.

The  compiled  notebook  will  be generated  directly  in  the  github
repository  via  a github  action  and  published,  if the  action  is
successful, to a gh-page.
A PDF can then be submitted
to    the   <a    href="https://computo.scholasticahq.com/for-authors"
style="outline: none; border:  none;">Computo submission platform</a>,
by means of the chrome print function.

More details can be found in the following templates, which serve
as material for starting to write your submission, and as a
documentation for doing so. The [process is described in a
dedicated post]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2021/submission-process/).
