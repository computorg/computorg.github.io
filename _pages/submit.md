## Overview

Submissions to Computo require both scientific content (typically
equations, codes and figures, data) and a proof that this content is
reproducible. This is achieved by means of i) a notebook system, ii) a
virtual environment fixing the dependencies and iii) continuous
integration (plus, if needed, an external website to store data
files such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [OSF](https://osf.io/) ).

A Computo submission is thus a git repository (e.g. Github or Gitlab) typically containing

- the source file of the notebook (a markdown  file with yaml metadata)
- auxiliary  files: a $$\mathrm{bib}\TeX  $$ file and some statics files, e.g. figures or small .csv data tables
- configuration files to set up the dependencies in a virtual environment
- configuration files to set up the continuous integration rendering the final documents

The compiled notebook (both HTML and PDF) will be directly generated
in the git(hub) repository via continuous integration (e.g., Github
action or Gitlab CI) and published, if the action is successful, 
to a web page (e.g. gh-page).

The PDF and the git repository address are then submitted via <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=Computo" style="outline: none; border:  none;"> OpenReview</a>.

## Submit your work

Once your are happy with your notebook AND the continuous integration (Github action or Gitlab CI) is successful, you must submit your PDF and the url of your git repository via [OpenReview, our platform for peer-reviewing](https://openreview.net/group?id=Computo).

## Reviewing and publication

Submitted papers are reviewed by external reviewers selected by the Associate Editor in charge of the paper.
Computo strives for fast reviewing cycles, but cannot provide strict guarantees on the matter; the current time between submission and publication is under six months.

In order to ensure an efficient reviewing process, authors are requested upon submission to suggest the names of four potential referees.  To avoid conflicts of interests, recent co-authors or collaborators should not be suggested.

Computo's accepted papers are published electronically immediately upon receipt under [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
Authors retain the copyright and full publishing rights without restrictions.

More information about the reviewing process are available on the [Review page]({{ site.baseurl }} /review)
