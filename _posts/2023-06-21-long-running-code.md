description: Discuss the reproducibility for long-running code

If your analyses, model tuning or training phase take a prohibitively long time to compile and integrate, you can include the results of the trained methods in the form of a binary file. However, you must provide the code enabling the user to fully reproduce the training phase, and illustrate your code in a small, toy-sized example.
