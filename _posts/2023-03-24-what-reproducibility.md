_Under Construction_

Computo is not just about publishing a notebook and proving that it can be compiled with CI! This part of the process is what we call “Editorial Reproducibility”. “Scientific” or “numerical” reproducibility of the analyses is also mandatory, on top of classical peer-review evaluation.

We don’t ask people reproducing their data… yet! We neither don’t ask for bit-wise reproducibility but at least statistical reproducibility.
