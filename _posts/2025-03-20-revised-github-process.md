# TL;DR

After cloning the right template for you (R, Python, or both), verify the `.github/workflows/build.yml`, it should contain exactly what is on the [Computo Workflow repository's `build.yml`](https://github.com/computorg/workflows/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml)Â :

``` yaml
name: Main Workflows

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main","master"]
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [custom-event] 
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main","master"]


jobs:
  call_env_workflow:
    uses: computorg/workflows/.github/workflows/global-env.yml@main
  call_quartopublish_workflow:
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write
      pages: write
    uses: computorg/workflows/.github/workflows/publish-render.yml@main
    needs: call_env_workflow
```

Second, in your `Settings > Pages` on your repository, select the **GitHub Actions** as the source of your website.

Then, you can customize the `setup-env-ci.sh` and `setup-render-ci.sh` scripts to fit your needs.
- `setup-env-ci.sh` is for setting up the environment and typically adding system dependencies. The virtual machine on github (runner) may need to install some packages with `apt-get` for R or Python packages.
- `setup-render-ci.sh` is for taking care of specific dependencies outside of quarto, related to rendering, like plotting software or running a script to generate data.

> **Note**
>
> You can safely delete the `gh-pages` branch if you have one, as we don't need anymore to push the HTML files to the site.

# Computo Workflow Structure

The Computo workflows provide a streamlined publishing pipeline for authors to submit and render Quarto articles directly on GitHub Pages without requiring technical expertise.

## Workflow Summary

The publication process consists of two main phases:

1.  **Environment Setup and Caching** (`global-env.yml`)
    -   Detects and installs required dependencies (Python, R)
    -   Caches the environment for faster subsequent runs
    -   Customizable via `setup-env-ci.sh`
2.  **Rendering and Deployment** (`publish-render.yml`)
    -   Renders Quarto documents to HTML
    -   Publish the output to GitHub Pages
    -   Customizable via `setup-render-ci.sh`

Authors only need to reference the main workflow file (`build.yml`) in their repository, which orchestrates these processes.

## Workflow Visualization

## Key Benefits

-   **Simplified Process**: Authors need minimal GitHub Actions knowledge
-   **Optimized Performance**: Environment caching for faster builds
-   **Customization Points**: Two script entry points for custom configurations
-   **Automated Deployment**: Direct publishing to GitHub Pages

Authors simply use the build.yml workflow in their repository to trigger the complete process from environment setup to final publication.
