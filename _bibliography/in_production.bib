  abstract = {We address the challenge of identifying multiple change
    points in a group of independent time series, assuming these change
    points occur simultaneously in all series and their number is
    unknown. The search for the best segmentation can be expressed as a
    minimization problem over a given cost function. We focus on dynamic
    programming algorithms that solve this problem exactly. When the
    number of changes is proportional to data length, an
    inequality-based pruning rule encoded in the PELT algorithm leads to
    a linear time complexity. Another type of pruning, called functional
    pruning, gives a close-to-linear time complexity whatever the number
    of changes, but only for the analysis of univariate time series. We
    propose a few extensions of functional pruning for multiple
    independent time series based on the use of simple geometric shapes
    (balls and hyperrectangles). We focus on the Gaussian case, but some
    of our rules can be easily extended to the exponential family. In a
    simulation study we compare the computational efficiency of
    different geometric-based pruning rules. We show that for a small
    number of time series some of them ran significantly faster than
    inequality-based approaches in particular when the underlying number
    of changes is small compared to the data length.}

  abstract = {Appropriate spatiotemporal modelling of wildfire activity
    is crucial for its prediction and risk management. Here, we focus on
    wildfire risk in the Aquitaine region in the Southwest of France and
    its projection under climate change. We study whether wildfire risk
    could further increase under climate change in this specific region,
    which does not lie in the historical core area of wildfires in
    Southeastern France, corresponding to the Southwest. For this
    purpose, we consider a marked spatiotemporal point process, a
    flexible model for occurrences and magnitudes of such environmental
    risks, where the magnitudes are defined as the burnt areas. The
    model is first calibrated using 14 years of past observation data of
    wildfire occurrences and weather variables, and then applied for
    projection of climate-change impacts using simulations of numerical
    climate models until 2100 as new inputs. We work within the
    framework of a spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model, and we
    present the workflow of its implementation for a large dataset at
    daily resolution for 8km-pixels using the INLA-SPDE approach. The
    assessment of the posterior distributions shows a satisfactory fit
    of the model for the observation period. We stochastically simulate
    projections of future wildfire activity by combining climate model
    output with posterior simulations of model parameters. Depending on
    climate models, spline-smoothed projections indicate low to moderate
    increase of wildfire activity under climate change. The increase is
    weaker than in the historical core area, which we attribute to
    different weather conditions (oceanic versus Mediterranean). Besides
    providing a relevant case study of environmental risk modelling,
    this paper is also intended to provide a full workflow for
    implementing the Bayesian estimation of marked log-Gaussian Cox
    processes using the R-INLA package of the R statistical software.}
