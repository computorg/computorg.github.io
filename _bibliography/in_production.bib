  abstract = {Litter is a known cause of degradation in marine
    environments and most of it travels in rivers before reaching the
    oceans. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to assist waste
    monitoring along watercourses. While several attempts have been made
    to quantify litter using neural object detection in photographs of
    floating items, we tackle the more challenging task of counting
    directly in videos using boat-embedded cameras. We rely on
    multi-object tracking (MOT) but focus on the key pitfalls of false
    and redundant counts which arise in typical scenarios of poor
    detection performance. Our system only requires supervision at the
    image level and performs Bayesian filtering via a state space model
    based on optical flow. We present a new open image dataset gathered
    through a crowdsourced campaign and used to train a center-based
    anchor-free object detector. Realistic video footage assembled by
    water monitoring experts is annotated and provided for evaluation.
    Improvements in count quality are demonstrated against systems built
    from state-of-the-art multi-object trackers sharing the same
    detection capabilities. A precise error decomposition allows clear
    analysis and highlights the remaining challenges.}
