  abstract = {Model-based clustering provides a principled way of
    developing clustering methods. We develop a new model-based
    clustering methods for count data. The method combines clustering
    and variable selection for improved clustering. The method is based
    on conditionally independent Poisson mixture models and Poisson
    generalized linear models. The method is demonstrated on simulated
    data and data from an ultra running race, where the method yields
    excellent clustering and variable selection performance.}
