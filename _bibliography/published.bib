  abstract =	 {Litter is a known cause of degradation in marine
                  environments and most of it travels in rivers before
                  reaching the oceans. In this paper, we present a
                  novel algorithm to assist waste monitoring along
                  watercourses. While several attempts have been made
                  to quantify litter using neural object detection in
                  photographs of floating items, we tackle the more
                  challenging task of counting directly in videos
                  using boat-embedded cameras. We rely on multi-object
                  tracking (MOT) but focus on the key pitfalls of
                  false and redundant counts which arise in typical
                  scenarios of poor detection performance. Our system
                  only requires supervision at the image level and
                  performs Bayesian filtering via a state space model
                  based on optical flow. We present a new open image
                  dataset gathered through a crowdsourced campaign and
                  used to train a center-based anchor-free object
                  detector. Realistic video footage assembled by water
                  monitoring experts is annotated and provided for
                  evaluation.  Improvements in count quality are
                  demonstrated against systems built from
                  state-of-the-art multi-object trackers sharing the
                  same detection capabilities. A precise error
                  decomposition allows clear analysis and highlights
                  the remaining challenges.}

  abstract =	 {Deep learning is used in computer vision problems
                  with important applications in several scientific
                  fields. In ecology for example, there is a growing
                  interest in deep learning for automatizing
                  repetitive analyses on large amounts of images, such
                  as animal species identification.  However, there
                  are challenging issues toward the wide adoption of
                  deep learning by the community of ecologists. First,
                  there is a programming barrier as most algorithms
                  are written in Python while most ecologists are
                  versed in R. Second, recent applications of deep
                  learning in ecology have focused on computational
                  aspects and simple tasks without addressing the
                  underlying ecological questions or carrying out the
                  statistical data analysis to answer these questions.
                  Here, we showcase a reproducible R workflow
                  integrating both deep learning and statistical
                  models using predator-prey relationships as a case
                  study. We illustrate deep learning for the
                  identification of animal species on images collected
                  with camera traps, and quantify spatial
                  co-occurrence using multispecies occupancy models.
                  Despite average model classification performances,
                  ecological inference was similar whether we analysed
                  the ground truth dataset or the classified
                  dataset. This result calls for further work on the
                  trade-offs between time and resources allocated to
                  train models with deep learning and our ability to
                  properly address key ecological questions with
                  biodiversity monitoring. We hope that our
                  reproducible workflow will be useful to ecologists
                  and applied statisticians.},
