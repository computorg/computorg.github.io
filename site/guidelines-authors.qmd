## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive documentation to accompany the authors during the writing of their contribution to Computo. It covers the requirements for submission, how to use the provided templates, how to set up dependencies, and how to ensure reproducibility through continuous integration and finally.

::: {.callout-tip title="TL;DR / summary of the whole guidelines"}

- **Official templates (R, Python, Julia)**:
  - Create a new GitHub repository from the appropriate template
  - This contains document, environment and CI configuration files

- **Local Setup**:
  - Clone the repository.
  - Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and the [Computo Quarto extension](https://github.com/computorg/computo-quarto-extension).
  - Ensure you can render the manuscript locally.

- **Writing Your Contribution**:
  - Main content goes in `template-computo-LANG.qmd`.
  - Metadata (title, authors, abstract, etc.) is set in `_quarto.yml`.
  - Edit using any text editor or IDE (VS Code/RStudio recommended).

- **Dependencies**:
  - Freeze package versions for reproducibility.
  - Use `renv` (R), `conda`/`requirements.txt` (Python), or `Project.toml` (Julia).
  - System dependencies can be installed via `setup-env-ci.sh` and `setup-render-ci.sh`.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
  - Uses GitHub Actions via a provided `build.yml` workflow.
  - Automatically builds and publishes HTML/PDF outputs to GitHub Pages.

- **Publishing**:
  - Push changes to GitHub; CI will build and deploy the site.
  - Submit the PDF and repository link to [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=Computo).
  - Ensure that the HTML is publicly accessible for reviewers on the GitHub Pages site.

## Step-by-step guide {#sec-guide}

Submissions to [Computo](https://computorg.github.io) require both scientific content (such as equations, code, figures, and data) and clear evidence that this content is reproducible. This is achieved through: i) a notebook system, ii) a virtual environment with frozen dependencies, and iii) continuous integration. If needed, large data files can be stored externally on platforms like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [OSF](https://osf.io/).

A Computo submission is therefore a Git(Hub) repository containing:

- the source files for the notebook (a Quarto `.qmd` file, a BibTeX `.bib` file, and any static files such as figures or small `.csv` data tables);
- configuration files to set up dependencies in a virtual environment;
- configuration files to enable continuous integration and render the final documents.

### Template repositories {#sec-templates}

The [Computo](https://github.com/computorg) organization provides template repositories for [R](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-R), [Python](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-python), and [Julia](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-julia) contributors.

These templates provide a starting point for authors to format their contributions according to Computo's guidelines. They include the necessary files and configurations to set up a reproducible environment and continuous integration

### Setup a git repository {#sec-git}

::: {.callout-note title="Git and GitHub"}
Git is a versioning tool and GitHub is an online platform owned by Microsoft which provides the service of hosting repositories with all the capabilities of versioning offered by Git.

Computo requires authors to submit their contribution as a GitHub repository. Hence, authors are expected to have basic knowledge of Git. We refer authors to the following online book which is particularly well written: <https://happygitwithr.com>.
:::

Create a new GitHub repository by navigating to the [R](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-R), [Python](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-python), or [Julia](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-julia) template repository and clicking the **"Use this template"** button at the top of the page, as shown in @fig-template.

![Screenshot of the R Computo template GitHub page.](/assets/img/computo-template-screenshot.png){#fig-template width="100%"}

::: {.callout-tip title="Branches"}
When you fork a GitHub repository – whether it is a classic repository or a template – GitHub will ask if you want to include all branches (there is a box labeled *Include all branches*). You only need to fork the main branch, so you do not need to check that box.
:::

::: {.callout-caution title="Public/private repository"}
The paper will be automatically published online using GitHub pages. This is possible only with public repositories (which is the default behavior when you initialize your repository from this template, see @fig-clone-template). If your prefer, it is fine to keep your repository private during the writing phase. However, we ask you to set it public at the submission stage; so that the paper can be rendered and published online for the reviewers.
:::

![Forking a GitHub template.](/assets/img/clone-template.png){#fig-clone-template width="100%"}

::: {.callout-note title="Using Gitlab"}
You can use Gitlab for submitting to Computo. We will be giving more detailed support for this in the future.
:::

### Local setup: clone, quarto, and computo extension {#sec-quarto}

First, clone the repository to your local computer. In a terminal, run:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone http://github.com/<user-name>/<repository-name>.git
```

You need to have [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and the [Computo extension](https://github.com/computorg/computo-quarto-extension) installed.

- Install Quarto: follow instructions at <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>.
- Once Quarto is installed, open a terminal in your cloned repo folder and run:


```bash
# Install computo quarto extension
quarto add computorg/computo-quarto-extension
```

::: {.callout-caution title="Multiple collaborators"}
If you are collaborating with others when writing your contributions, **each collaborator** needs to perform these same three steps (clone the repository, install Quarto and install the Computo Quarto extension).
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Multiple languages"}
Quarto relies on a specific engine to compile your document. By default, that engine detects code blocks, executes them and paste the result below the code block in the rendered document.

It is possible to use multiple languages within the same document (e.g. R and Python or Python and Julia, etc.) provided that you use the **knitr** engine. Indeed, [**knitr**](https://yihui.org/knitr/) is an R package that is able to parse code blocks from many languages. This can be achieved by specifying `engine: knitr` in your document metadata. The default engine binding that Quarto uses is detailed here: <https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html#engine-binding>.
:::

::: {.callout-caution title="Local compilation"}
Before proceeding to the next step,  make sure that you are able to build your manuscript as a standard notebook on your system by running the following command in a terminal:

```bash
# will render both to html and PDF
quarto render
```
:::

### Write your contribution {#sec-writing}

There are mainly two files you are expected to modify in your repository for writing your contribution: `template-computo-LANG.qmd` (where LANG is to be replaced with either R, Python or Julia) and `_quarto.yml`. While the first can be renamed (e.g, `submission-YYYYMM-firstAuthor-keyword.qmd`), the second must remain `_quarto.yml` as it contains metadata about your contribution shared between project's files.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Editing your project
You can edit your project using any text editor, but we recommend using an IDE such as [vsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). These IDEs provide syntax highlighting, code completion, and other features that make editing Quarto files easier.
:::

#### Metadata of your contribution

All yaml metadata should preferably be placed in the `_quarto.yml` file. To customise title, authors, date, abstract and so on, you should modify `_quarto.yml` which by default looks like this:

```yml
project:
  type: default
  render:
    - template-computo-LANG.qmd
    - README.qmd

title: "Template for contribution to Computo"
subtitle: "Example dedicated to `LANG` users"

  This document provides a template based on the [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/) system for contributions to Computo, using the [`quarto journal extension`](https://github.com/computorg/computo-quarto-extension), the knitr kernel (R user) and [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to set-up the dependencies.

Nam mollis lorem sit amet pellentesque ullamcorper. Curabitur lobortis libero eget malesuada vestibulum. Nam nec nibh massa. Pellentesque porttitor cursus tellus. Mauris urna erat, rhoncus sed faucibus sit amet, venenatis eu ipsum.
keywords: [key1, key2, key3]
bibliography: references.bib
github-user: computorg
repo: "template-computo-r"
draft: true # set to false once the build is running
published: false # will be set to true once accepted
license: CC-BY-4.0
format:
  computo-html: default
  computo-pdf: default
```

You can customize most of the entries in that file except `project:`, `published:`, `draft:`, `license:` and `format:`. If your contribution is accepted for publication, the associate editors will modify parts of this file accordingly.

#### Main content of your contribution

The main content of your contribution must be written in the `template-computo-LANG.qmd` file (see formatting suggestion therein). To compile your contribution, run `quarto render` anytime needed.

We also provide a `README.qmd` file as part of the project. This file uses shortcodes to extract metadata from `_quarto.yml` and generate a `README.md` that will be displayed on the main page of your GitHub repository. The `README.md` file is rendered automatically when you run `quarto render` at the root of your repository. You may modify the `README.qmd` file if you wish, at your own risk. If your submission is accepted, it will be standardized by the Computo team.

### Setup dependencies {#sec-dependencies}

The next step is to inform Computo of the other packages, tools and environment that your paper might depend upon. It is important to freeze their versions to ensure reproducibility. This step is inherently handled differently whether you are an R, Python or Julia user.

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
#### R users

{{< include _handle_dependencies_R.qmd >}}
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" collapse="true"}
#### Python users

{{< include _handle_dependencies_python.qmd >}}
:::

::: {.callout-important icon="false" collapse="true"}
#### Julia users

{{< include _handle_dependencies_julia.qmd >}}
:::

### Ensure reproducibility {#sec-reproducibility}

Now that you have written your contribution in the correct template and set up its dependencies, you need to set up continuous integration via GitHub Actions in order to ensure reproducibility of your work and its publication as a webpage.

#### Use Computo's built-in GitHub Action workflow

Computo has a built-in workflow for just that purpose which comes in the form of a YAML file describing a GitHub Action. It should have been automatically added to your repository when you cloned one of our templates. It is located under `.github/workflows/build.yml`.

::: {.callout-important title="Content of `build.yml`"}
Authors should **under no circumstances** modify this file. If you encounter a problem (such as the CI not completing successfully), please get in touch with us at <contact@computo-journal.org>.
:::

Next, as illustrated in @fig-deploy, under `Settings > Pages` on the webpage of your repository, select **GitHub Actions** as the source for building and deploying your website.

![Deploy your website with GitHub Actions](/assets/img/2025-03-20-revised-github-process/depoy-github.png){#fig-deploy width="100%"}

Authors can find more details about Computo's workflow [in the corresponding FAQ entry](../blog/2025-07-31-computo-workflow/index.html).

::: {.callout-note title="Compatibility with old reproducibility system"}
You can safely delete the `gh-pages` branch if you have one, as we don't need anymore to push the HTML files to the site.
:::

#### Handle external *system* dependencies

While R, Python, or Julia package dependencies should be managed using the appropriate environment tools, your project may also require external *system* dependencies (such as libraries or command-line tools). These must be installed on the GitHub runner during environment setup or rendering. To handle this, add and customize two scripts at the root of your repository:

- `setup-env-ci.sh` is meant to install system dependencies required to set up the environment in the GitHub runner. Here is an example of such a file taken from a published article:

```bash
# The CI runs on Linux Ubuntu, here goes system dependencies
# needed at environment setup step
sudo apt-get install -y libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

- `setup-render-ci.sh` is meant to install system dependencies required for rendering the paper, like plotting software or running a script to generate data. Here is an example of such a file taken from a published article:

```bash
# The CI runs on Linux Ubuntu, here goes system dependencies
# needed at rendering step
sudo apt-get install -y libblas-dev liblapack-dev
```

::: {.callout-warning title="Ubuntu GitHub runner"}
Remember that the GitHub runner uses Linux Ubuntu and therefore software installation is achieved through `apt-get`. Furthermore, you must precede calls to `apt-get` with the word `sudo` to indicate that you wish to run this command as an administrator.
:::

### Push to GitHub {#sec-ppush-git}

Once you have finished part of your writing and confirmed that the document builds successfully locally, you can push your changes to GitHub as you would with any Git project. If everything is set up correctly, the continuous integration workflow will automatically build and publish the HTML and PDF versions online.

::: {.callout-caution}
## Ignored files
Make sure to check and update the `.gitignore` file in your repository. In particular, if you changed the name of some files in the repository (like the main `.qmd` file), make propagate this change to the `.gitignore` file in order to avoid pushing binary files to the repository (such as the PDF file). 
:::

### Submit your manuscript {#sec-submitting}

Once you are satisfied with your manuscript, you can submit it for review. To do so, upload the generated PDF to the [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=Computo) platform and indicate the corresponding Git repository. This will initiate both the scientific and reproducibility review processes.

Please also ensure that the HTML version of your manuscript is publicly accessible for reviewers on the GitHub Pages site associated with your repository. To do so, complete the description of your repository (below the "about" section) by ticking the box labeled "Use your Github page Website" (see image below).

![Acces to HTML via GitHub page.](/assets/img/Github-page-access.png){#fig-github-page-acess width="100%" fig-align="center"}


For more details about the review process, see the [guidelines for reviewers](/site/guidelines-reviewers.qmd).

### Accepted manuscript {#sec-acceptance}

If your submission is accepted for publication, you will be asked to transfer the ownership of the repository that hosts your paper to the Computo GitHub organization. To do that, you must go on the main page of your repository in a web browser and click on the *Settings* tab as indicated in @fig-transfer-ownership-1.

![Accessing the settings of a GitHub repository.](/assets/img/transfer-ownership.001.png){#fig-transfer-ownership-1 width="100%" fig-align="center"}

Once inside the settings of the repository, scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page until you see **Danger Zone** in red color and click on *Transfer* as indicated in @fig-transfer-ownership-2.

![Accessing the interface for ownership transfer.](/assets/img/transfer-ownership.002.png){#fig-transfer-ownership-2 width="100%" fig-align="center"}

A new page opens where you need to select *Specify an organization or username* and write `computorg` (see @fig-transfer-ownership-3). Then you type what is asked in the blank box and click on *I understand, transfer this repository* and you're all set!

![The ownership transfer page.](/assets/img/transfer-ownership.003.png){#fig-transfer-ownership-3 width="100%" fig-align="center"}

## Advanced examples {#sec-examples}

### Mock contributions

In addition to the template repositories that can serve as example papers (see @sec-templates), we provide more in-depth illustrations of the expected content and available features through mock contributions consisting of a complete reworking of the famous t-SNE article.

::: {#examples}
:::

### Previously published papers

::: {.callout-tip title="Reproducing a paper"}
For other advanced examples, do not hesitate to explore the source code of any [paper already published in Computo](https://computo-journal.org/site/publications.html) to see how the template is used in practice. In particular, reproducing an existing paper published in Computo can be easily done [as detailed in the FAQ](../blog/2025-07-31-reproduce-paper/index.html).
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
## Accessing source code
You can also access the source code of the example papers mentioned above by clicking on the `</> Source` button in the upper-right corner of the page as illustrated in @fig-template-source.
:::

![Accessing sources of the rendered example papers.](/assets/img/computo-template-r-source.png){#fig-template-source width="100%"}

The source code of the page then displays as shown in @fig-template-source-display and the user can click on the icon in the upper-right corner to copy the source code for practicing locally.
