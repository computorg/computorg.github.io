    We present a new technique called “t-SNE” that visualizes
        high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two
        or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic
        Neighbor Embedding {[}@hinton:stochastic{]} that is much easier to
        optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by
        reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the
        map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single
        map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is
        particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several
        different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of
        objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For
        visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE
        can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit
        structure of all the data to influence the way in which a subset of
        the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a
        wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other
        non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping,
        Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualization produced by
        t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by other
        techniques on almost all of the data sets.
