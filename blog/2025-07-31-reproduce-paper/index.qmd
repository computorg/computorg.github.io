Our publication workflow makes it very easy for anyone to reproduce a given paper. Consider for instance the paper <https://doi.org/10.57750/sfxn-1t05> associated with the Github repository [published-202412-giorgi-efficient][https://github.com/computorg/published-202412-giorgi-efficient]. You first need to clone the repository. Then you need to install Quarto and the Computo Quarto extension in the `published-202412-giorgi-efficient` folder that the cloning step made. Finally, you can render the document. In summary, you do that with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/computorg/published-202412-giorgi-efficient.git
cd published-202412-giorgi-efficient
quarto add computorg/computo-quarto-extension
quarto render
```
