If your analyses, model tuning or training phase take a prohibitively long
time to compile and integrate, you can include the results of the trained
methods in the form of a binary file. However, you must provide the code
enabling the user to fully reproduce the training phase, and illustrate your
code in a small, toy-sized example.
