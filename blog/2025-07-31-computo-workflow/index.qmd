The Computo workflows provide a streamlined publishing pipeline for authors to submit and render Quarto articles directly on GitHub Pages without requiring technical expertise.

### Workflow Summary

![Computo Workflow Structure](/assets/img/2025-03-20-revised-github-process/workflow.svg){#fig-workflow width="100%"}

As illustrated in @fig-workflow, the publication process consists of two main phases:

1.  **Environment Setup and Caching** (`global-env.yml`)
    -   Detects and installs required dependencies (Python, R)
    -   Caches the environment for faster subsequent runs
    -   Customizable via `setup-env-ci.sh`
2.  **Rendering and Deployment** (`publish-render.yml`)
    -   Renders Quarto documents to HTML
    -   Publish the output to GitHub Pages
    -   Customizable via `setup-render-ci.sh`

Authors only need to reference the main workflow file (`build.yml`) in their repository, which orchestrates these processes.

### Key Benefits

-   **Simplified Process**: Authors need minimal GitHub Actions knowledge
-   **Optimized Performance**: Environment caching for faster builds
-   **Customization Points**: Two script entry points for custom configurations
-   **Automated Deployment**: Direct publishing to GitHub Pages

Authors simply use the `build.yml` workflow in their repository to trigger the complete process from environment setup to final publication.
